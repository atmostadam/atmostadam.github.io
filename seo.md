[//]: # (Side Business: Internet Sales & Lead Generation)

My business partner(s) and I took a 3 pronged approach to internet marketing using a variety of white-hat techniques to legitimately get our CPC, Affliate or Private Practice website(s) to the first page of Google and often position #1 for localized keywords.

# Read Me
With great power comes great responsibility. Most internet marketers are shady characters that we must always avoid and never become. I very rarely share this information anymore because I have friends who went down paths such as:

- Burying criminal records
- Review bombing
- Manipulating google algorithms
- Posting false information (libel, defamation of character, etc.)
- Dumping negative backlinks on competitors
- Bulk content submission and bots [tbh may have contributed]
- Keyword stuffing

This could happen to you. Be warned.

# Lesson Learned
- We should have all taken a salary before net income payouts.
- We should have hired an accountant and/or tax lawyer
- We also strongly recommend purchasing small business insurance

# Techniques
## Affiliate Sales
- Amazon Affiliate Program: https://affiliate-program.amazon.com
## Cost Per Click
- Google AdWords (Google Ads) https://ads.google.com
## Individual Sales
- Keller Williams Real Estate Michigan: https://michigan.kw.com

# Targeting Keywords
- We exclusively used Google Adwords Keyword Planner
    - https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/
- We started broad and drilled down into multiple word keywords focusing on high volume, low competition words.
- For our real estate small business we also put out ads (free Google Ads Promotions where possible) to calculate our lead conversion.

# How to backlink
- Most backlinks that I used had keywords withing the a href element. However, one of my partners made the title of a blog post page the keyword with a link directly to that blog post

# Content on Our Websites
## Images
Although our team did not have a graphic designer we created our own images, took our own pictures and licensed images from image companies. We found that purchaising images were the best for lead generation/conversion and did not notice an SEO impact. However, Google may find duplication on images purchased from a 3rd party.

## Videos
There was a disagreement among the partners in this area. Some of us thought that embedding a YouTube link was sufficient whereas

# Marketing Strategies
In order of effectiveness that we found.  RESULTS WILL VARY!  Google's algorithm changes multiple times per day and it has been a few years.

## Press Releases 
Our experience showed this to be the most effective. This is especially true when one of our articles got syndicated to a variety of legitimate newspapers and news websites that we were actually familiar with.

## Affiliate Specific

## Individual Sales Specific
- Reviewing process that specifically focused on information that could not be found on Amazon at that time when it was smaller. This would often include things like:

# Affiliate Product Sales
  - Information from the Better Business Bureau
  - Product recall information
  - Company's history of quality
  - Manufacturing location
  - Production batch size
  - Replaceable parts
  - Aggregated reviews
  - Product trials
  - Many, many others





## Closing Information
- At time of dissolving the business, it was still making enough for one of us to have a middle income. However, the 3 of us were all investing in our future and all 3 agree we made the right move. There was so much invaluable information learned that the business as a learning experience was worth the amount of time we put into it.
- A full time career, graduate school, this side business, an inhospitable business environment (States Sales Tax vs. Amazon) and a daughter on the way was too much so I left the business to the originating partner.
- Our originating partner sold off the business in the mid-2010s to focus on his primary discipline, archeology.
- Keller Williams sent a bunch of unexpected percentage-based fees that made Michigan's real estate business case no longer viable so our real estate agent partner decided to move onto other small business enterprises where he has done very well.
